    docker compose build backend - This builds a Docker image for the backend service based on the instructions in the Dockerfile located in the backend directory.
    docker compose rm --stop backend - This removes any existing containers running the backend service, and stops them if they are currently running.
    docker compose up -d backend - This starts up a new container running the backend service in detached mode, which means it runs in the background.
    By running it in a detached mode, we do not have to stop the currently running docker log. instead it will restart itself.
    
    When you run a Docker container in detached mode, it means the container runs in the background and doesn't keep your terminal session occupied. This is in contrast to running the container in the foreground, where you would see logs and other output from the container in your terminal.
So when you run the docker compose up -d command, you're telling Docker to run the containers in detached mode. This means that the containers will be running in the background and you can continue to use your terminal for other things without interruption.

    npx prisma generate generates a prisma client and types for all the values

    docker compose exec - this runs something in a ALREADY RUNNING container whereas docker compose run creates a separate container for you
    db:migrate will run where our terminal is. instead we want to run the migrations against the containers of backend and postgres database
